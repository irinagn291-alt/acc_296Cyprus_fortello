## 1. Non-negotiable constraints

1. **No CocoaPods.** Dependencies come from Swift Package Manager, a local
   in-repo package, a vendored source folder, or nothing at all — per section 3.
2. **No shared code with other portfolio apps.** Business rules are re-implemented
   here under this app's own type names.
3. **All code, identifiers, comments, UI copy and the README are in English.**
4. **No launch gate, no WebView shell, no remote configuration, no analytics.**
   Guideline 4.2 (Minimum Functionality): this is a native SwiftUI product, not
   a web browsing experience. WKWebView / SFSafariViewController as UI is a
   reject. Push notifications, Core Location, and sharing do not make a
   browser or a thin catalog into an App Store app.
5. **Guideline 5.1.1 (Privacy):** never direct the user to grant camera access.
   A pre-permission screen may exist; the proceed button is **Continue** or
   **Next**, never "Allow camera", "Enable camera", "Grant camera", or a bare
   Allow/Enable that triggers `requestAccess`. The system alert is the only Allow.
6. **No CI files.** No `bitrise.yml`, no `Scripts/`, no `metadata/` folder.
7. **Assets are AI-generated.** No stock photography. SF Symbols may support
   small affordances but must never be the primary iconography.
8. **The app must build clean** with
   `xcodegen generate && xcodebuild -scheme Tetraptych -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' build`.
9. **Nothing may echo another app in this batch** in naming, layout or visuals.
10. **This is not a calorie meal-slot tracker** unless family is `food_tracker`.
   Do not invent food logging to fill the brief.

## 2. Product core

The product is offline-first. No account, no sign-in, no ads, no in-app purchase,
no analytics SDK, no remote config. All user data stays on the device.

A learner taps the canvas that matches the written cue so the painting shelves as learned.

### 2.1 User flow

1. Tap the canvas that matches the cue line
2. Open Explore and save another work into the crate
3. Deal a new cue so a fresh artist or title line appears
4. Open Saved to read CallMarks and FaultMarks
5. Undo the latest CallMark from the dock

### 2.2 Essential behaviour

- Quiz draws only from saved works
- Each Deal writes one Cue as Artist or as Title, never both
- Four-face lineup with three decoys from the crate
- FaultMarks stay reviewable on Saved
- Local-only crate with one Met collection voice
- Seed stores six Works so the first Deal already hangs four faces
- No shop, no stars, no shopping list

### 3.0 Product concept

This is the product the contracts below are assigned to. Do not substitute another.

**Family** — art_quiz

**Core** — A learner taps the canvas that matches the written cue so the painting shelves as learned.

**Audience** — People who remember an artist name or a title and want to find that face among works they already saved, not name a painting that is already hanging.

**User flow**

1. Tap the canvas that matches the cue line
2. Open Explore and save another work into the crate
3. Deal a new cue so a fresh artist or title line appears
4. Open Saved to read CallMarks and FaultMarks
5. Undo the latest CallMark from the dock

**Essential features**

- Quiz draws only from saved works
- Each Deal writes one Cue as Artist or as Title, never both
- Four-face lineup with three decoys from the crate
- FaultMarks stay reviewable on Saved
- Local-only crate with one Met collection voice
- Seed stores six Works so the first Deal already hangs four faces
- No shop, no stars, no shopping list

**Twist** — Cue-then-call. The lineup stays on screen. Deal writes a Cue as Artist or Title and hangs four Faces from saved Works. Tapping the true Face writes a CallMark and files that Work as Called. A wrong tap files a FaultMark, dims that Face, and the Cue remains. Deal with fewer than four Works writes Idle. A second Deal while Cued is refused. Explore files a Work as Loose; saving the same object again focuses that row. Called works rest on Saved and exit the deal pool. Undo lifts the latest CallMark or FaultMark. Seed stores six Works so the first Deal already hangs four faces. Home verb: call-the-lineup, not name-the-hanging-work. Saved tallies CallMarks and FaultMarks. Settings names The Metropolitan Museum of Art as the catalog source. Stars and a shopping list do not exist.

**Why this is not a repeat** — Cartellino sits one hanging work and names it with artist chips then title chips. This app inverts that tap: the cue is a written artist line or a written title line, and the learner picks one face among four. Home is a lime athletic lineup with a billboard cue and a dock, not a charcoal easel. Called is a single-field file, not a Tombstone walk from Blank through Named to Titled. Explore still saves into one public collection and the quiz still draws only from that crate, so art_quiz holds, but the persisted verb is call-the-lineup. FaultMarks replace sequential miss-and-keep-the-same-work naming. The Met is the collection voice, not the Art Institute of Chicago.

### 3.0a Craft from the shipped portfolio

Full craft is in KNOWLEDGE.md. Follow it. Do not copy type names or layouts.
- Home: Explore → saved → quiz artist or title.
- Invariant: Quiz draws from saved works. Misses are reviewable. Collecting without a test is the crate clone.
- Never: One collection voice. No shop.
- Desk `cue_punctuality`: fireAt=runStart+Σprior+offset; punctuality=1−min(1,|actual−planned|/1.5s).
- Taste DNA is section 7.6. Do not invent a second look.
- A TabView with exactly three tabs is the factory stamp — use two or four-to-five destinations, or a different chrome. `-ReviewScreen today|log|goals` are launch keys, not tabs.

### 3.1 Architecture contract

Lineup is a closed algebraic fold with cases Idle, Cued, and Called; a fourth case is a defect. The pinacotheca is a fold over Works: Deal samples a Work that is not Called, writes one Cue as Artist or as Title never both, and hangs four Faces, one true and three Loose decoys from the crate. Deal with fewer than four Loose Works writes Idle, and a second Deal while Cued is refused. A matching Call writes a CallMark, files that Work as Called so it leaves the deal pool, and folds Cued to Called; a miss writes a FaultMark, dims that Face, and keeps the Cue. Undo peels the newest CallMark or FaultMark, a CallMark returns that Work to Loose and folds Called back to Cued with the same Cue and Faces, and a FaultMark undims that Face. Explore files a Work as Loose with daykey Int YYYYMMDD from Calendar.current.startOfDay, a duplicate object id focuses the existing row, one observable LineupStore pattern-matches the fold, views call dealCue, callFace, missFace, and peelLatestMark, and unit tests prove not-Called sampling, four-face hang, Deal-while-Cued refuse, under-four Idle, Call file, miss keep, Undo fold-back, and duplicate focus.

Put a short comment block at the top of each principal type stating the role it
plays in this architecture. The README must justify the pattern for this product.

### 3.2 UI contract

100 percent SwiftUI, Light. No UIViewRepresentable, no WKWebView, no Safari sheet, no camera preview, no TabView. The ui axis restates SwiftUI pure with take-token lineup: compose an original four-face pinacotheca, not one hanging work with name chips, not a two-canvas pair, and not a title-then-artist row. Do not copy holder file trees, type names, or layouts. Do not ship a title screen named SwiftUI or lineup. Home is the mechanic: Quiz is a 2x2 of four Faces filling remaining height and the iPad width, a thick-frame Cue billboard above, and a dock of real Buttons for Deal and Undo. Call fuses on the Face Buttons. Confine any custom drawing to that one Quiz hero (Shape, Path); Explore, Saved, and Settings are stock sheets (List, Form). Taste is already Chartreuse bold accent / neobrutal thick-frame: dense raw grid, one offset sticker on the Cue kind, thick border on the lineup hero only, hairline+fill elevation, kit radii 12 and 8 through one accessor, bordered prominent primary. Do not add a second shadow kit or a glass UI kit. Primary Deal uses a ButtonStyle with default, pressed, disabled, and loading. resetAllData uses the destructive variant. Faces, dock, and sheet rows are native Buttons with contentShape, min 44pt, one target on the whole chrome. Empty Quiz (Idle), empty Explore, and empty Saved are full pages (frame maxHeight infinity) with generated cutout art, one headline, one line, and a bottom full-width CTA. Snap motion: press scale 0.97 in 140 to 180ms ease-out, sheets scale 0.96 to 1 plus fade; Reduce Motion is opacity only. Colour is never the only miss signal; a miss also dims and strikes the Face. One haptic on a successful CallMark, none on FaultMark, none on presenting a sheet. VoiceOver labels on every icon-only sheet control. Tactical voice, status first, no em dash, no emoji. The ui axis string is never a section title.

### 3.3 Naming contract

Convention: Pinacotheca / lineup lexicon.

Examples to follow: `Pinacotheca`, `CallMark`, `dealCue()`, `peelLatestMark()`

### 3.4 Dependency contract

None. project.yml has no packages key. No SPM, no CocoaPods, no bundled font. SF Pro is the system face. Foundation, SwiftUI, and URLSession only. The leftover AVCaptureMetadataOutput scanner stays unused: do not import AVFoundation or Vision for capture, do not request camera access, and do not ship NSCameraUsageDescription. Honor the cgi search pl assignment as paginated JSON search: query, json, page, page_size mapped onto GET https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/public/collection/v1/search with q and hasImages=true, then slice objectIDs by page and page_size and GET https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/public/collection/v1/objects/{id}. Never call world.openfoodfacts.org or /cgi/search.pl. Never call api.artic.edu. Never Open Food Facts, calories, meal slots, or a food catalog. Dedicated JSONDecoder. DTO CodingKeys map Met camelCase (objectID, artistDisplayName, primaryImageSmall, isPublicDomain, objectURL, accessionNumber) without convertFromSnakeCase, then map to domain Work. Prefer isPublicDomain with a non-empty primaryImageSmall. Set User-Agent Tetraptych/1.0 (iOS; +https://tetraptych-lineup.pro) on every request. Debounce search about 500 ms, cancel the previous Task, empty query does not hit the network. Cache resolved works locally so empty or failed search still hangs from the bundled crate shelf. Settings credits The Metropolitan Museum of Art as tappable source links (https://www.metmuseum.org and https://www.metmuseum.org/policies/open-access).

### 3.5 Navigation contract

Lineup-locked chrome: Quiz is the root four-face lineup and never leaves. There is no TabView and no pushed museum detail. Deal, Call on a Face, and Undo fuse on Quiz. Explore, Saved, and Settings arrive as sheets over the lineup. Four destinations, never exactly three tabs. App Intents open Quiz, Explore, Saved, or Settings, or fire dealCue in place. Custom URL scheme tetraptych routes tetraptych://quiz, tetraptych://explore, tetraptych://saved, tetraptych://settings, and the matching https://tetraptych-lineup.pro paths into those same jobs. One haptic on a successful CallMark, none on presenting a sheet. Contact URL https://tetraptych-lineup.pro/contact-us lives on Settings. Undo is also reachable from Settings. After onboarding, read ProcessInfo.processInfo.arguments once: -ReviewScreen today stays on Quiz, log presents Saved, goals presents Settings. Extra key explore presents Explore. Skip onboarding on Simulator after the tpt.demo.v1 seed so the hook can fire.

### 3.6 Screen composition contract

Deep link routed screens · artquiz2 · lineup. Physical screens: Quiz, Explore, Saved, Settings. Quiz is the locked four-face lineup (ReviewScreen today): Deal writes a Cue as Artist or Title and hangs four Faces; Call taps the matching Face; Undo peels the latest mark; status shows IDLE, CUED, CALLED, FAULT. Explore is a sheet that searches The Metropolitan Museum of Art and writes a Loose Work, with a local crate shelf when search is empty or fails (deep link explore). Saved is a sheet of Called works, CallMarks, and FaultMarks (ReviewScreen log). Settings is a Form for collection credit, Undo, contact URL at https://tetraptych-lineup.pro/contact-us, re-run onboarding, and resetAllData (ReviewScreen goals). Onboarding is a one-shot cover of three pages with Continue or Next at the bottom full width. Empty Quiz with fewer than four Loose Works is Idle as a full page: generated cutout art, headline Crate short., one line Save four works, then deal., full-width bottom Explore. Empty Explore and empty Saved are full pages of their own. Seeded Quiz already hangs four Faces so Call is live; Idle is a test fixture, not the first frame. No Today, Scan, Search, or Goals screens. ReviewScreen today, log, and goals must open three different screens.

Section 5 lists the logical functions that must exist. This section decides how
they are grouped into actual screens. Where the two disagree, this section wins.

A TabView with exactly three tabs is the factory stamp — use two or four-to-five destinations, or a different chrome. `-ReviewScreen today|log|goals` are launch keys, not tabs.

## 4. Target file organization

Scheme: **By lineup role (Lineup, Work, Cue, Face, CallMark, FaultMark)**

```
Tetraptych/
  Lineup/
  Lineup.swift
  Pinacotheca.swift
  LineupStore.swift
  QuizView.swift
  LineupLinks.swift
Work/
  Work.swift
  ExploreView.swift

  CrateShelf.swift
Cue/
  Cue.swift
Face/
  Face.swift
CallMark/
  CallMark.swift
FaultMark/

  Assets.xcassets/
```

Adapt the leaf files to the architecture, but the top-level shape is fixed. Do
not create a `Utils/` or `Helpers/` dumping ground.

---

## 5. Screens

Build the screens named in section 3.6. The labels below are logical;
actual type names follow this app's naming convention.

### 5.1 Onboarding
Three to four pages. Explains the product, writes initial settings, sets a
completion flag. Skip still writes sensible defaults. Re-runnable from Settings.

### 5.2 Explore
A first-class screen for **Explore**. Must render empty, populated and error states.

### 5.3 Saved
A first-class screen for **Saved**. Must render empty, populated and error states.

### 5.4 Quiz
A first-class screen for **Quiz**. Must render empty, populated and error states.

### 5.5 Settings
A first-class screen for **Settings**. Must render empty, populated and error states.

### 5.6 Settings
Holds: re-run onboarding, reset all data (confirmed), and the contact link to
the domain contact-us URL.

### 5.7 Twist screen
See section 12. The twist needs at least one screen of its own plus a surface on the home screen.


---

## 6. Domain model

Minimum entities, named per this app's convention:

- **Work** — named per this app's convention.
- **QuizCard** — named per this app's convention.
- Plus whatever the twist in section 12 requires.


---

## 7. Design system

Direction: **Chartreuse bold accent**

### 7.1 Palette

| Token | Hex | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `background` | `#FAF8F5` | Screen background |
| `surface` | `#FEFEFD` | Cards, rows, sheets |
| `ink` | `#392A18` | Primary text and icons |
| `accent` | `#C8781E` | Primary action, key figure, progress fill |
| `muted` | `#7E6F5D` | Secondary text, dividers, disabled |

Define these as named colours in `Assets.xcassets` and reach them through one
typed accessor. Never hard-code a hex string anywhere else.

### 7.2 Typography

Family: **SF Pro**

SF Pro via Font.system as the Chartreuse type move: heavy grotesque, hard size jumps, labels in mono. Display is the Cue billboard, SF Pro Heavy or Black, short and wide, one or two lines, about 2.5x body, never above 34pt. Body is SF Pro about 17pt for Saved rows and Explore titles. Caption and micro use Font.system design monospaced for dock and status labels DEAL, UNDO, IDLE, CUED, CALLED, FAULT, ARTIST, TITLE. At most six named steps behind one accessor: display, title, headline, body, caption, micro. Weights and step carry hierarchy. No Font.custom, no fixedSize, never below 12pt, no serif, no second family. CallMark counts, FaultMark counts, and day keys go through NumberFormatter with tabular figures. Dynamic Type; at AX5 the Cue may drop a step so it never clips; names truncate, numbers win. Day edges use Calendar.current.startOfDay then fold to Int YYYYMMDD.

Define a type scale of at most six steps behind one accessor and use only those
steps. Text stays legible at the largest Dynamic Type size.

### 7.3 Layout

- One base spacing unit (4 or 8 pt); only multiples of it.
- Corner radius and elevation are fixed by section 7.4, not chosen per screen.
- Every interactive element is at least 44x44 pt.

### 7.4 Component contract

Corner radius: **12pt** for cards, sheets and primary surfaces; **8pt** for chips, badges and small controls. Reach both through one accessor. Never a bare literal number, and never zero — a hard edge is not this app's design direction.

Elevation: **hairline+fill** — a 1pt hairline border plus a flat fill tint, reused everywhere a surface sits above another.

Primary control: **bordered prominent** — primary actions use `.buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)` or an equivalent filled, bordered shape.

This is arithmetic, not a suggestion: every card, sheet, chip and button in this app uses these two radii and this elevation style. Do not introduce a second radius or a second elevation style.

### 7.5 Custom rendering scope

This app's `ui` axis is **SwiftUI pure · take lineup**.

If that approach uses anything beyond stock SwiftUI/UIKit controls — `Canvas`, `CALayer`, Metal, SceneKit, SpriteKit, RealityKit, a hand-drawn `UIViewRepresentable`, or any other pixel-level custom rendering — confine it to exactly one hero surface on one screen (the mechanic's home view, or the one screen this axis exists to showcase). Every other screen — every list, every settings screen, every sheet, every secondary surface — is built from stock components: `List`, `Form`, `NavigationStack`, `TabView`, `Button`, `.sheet`, native `Text`/`Image`. A second custom-rendered surface elsewhere in the app is a defect, not a stylistic choice.

If **SwiftUI pure · take lineup** is already fully native (no custom drawing layer), this section is satisfied automatically — there is nothing to confine.

The `ui` axis value is an implementation choice. It must never appear as a user-visible section title or label.

This assignment restates a catalog technique another app already holds. Write a new composition: new types, new layout, new motion. Do not copy source, file trees, or type names from the holder.

### 7.6 Taste DNA

Aesthetic: **brutal** (Brutal / tactical: visible structure, thick rules, hard contrast.)

Reference system: **neobrutalism** — steal rhythm and restraint, not their colours or logos.

Mood: **loud**.

Home rhythm (`thick-frame`, dense): Thick frame, raw grid, one offset sticker. Hard edges are the kit radii.

Neo-brutal: thick border on the hero only, hard offset shadow if elevation is shadow. Do not soften it with blur.

Type move: Heavy grotesque, hard size jumps, labels in mono.

Motion (`snap`): Press scale 0.97, 140-180ms ease-out. Sheets scale 0.96 to 1 plus fade. Reduce Motion: opacity only.

Voice (`tactical`): Status-first. Noun plus state. 'Scan failed. Try again.'

Anti-slop from KNOWLEDGE.md applies. Taste never overrides contrast, 44pt hits, VoiceOver labels, or Reduce Motion.

---

## 8. UI and UX quality bar

Every item here is a defect if it is missing. Do not treat this as advice.

**Layout**

- Respect safe areas on every screen. Nothing sits under the notch, the Dynamic
  Island or the home indicator.
- The app is portrait-only on iPhone. Lock it in the Info settings and do not
  write rotation-dependent layout.
- No layout shift when asynchronous data arrives. Reserve the final size up
  front, or use a redacted placeholder of the same dimensions.
- Long product names must truncate gracefully, never push a number off screen.
  Numbers win; names truncate.
- Minimum tap target 44x44 pt for every interactive element, including small
  icon buttons and list accessories.
- Pick one base spacing unit and use only multiples of it. No arbitrary values.

**Keyboard**

- The grams field uses `.decimalPad`, and the decimal separator matches the
  user's locale.
- Content scrolls out from under the keyboard. The focused field is always
  visible.
- Tapping outside the field, or scrolling, dismisses the keyboard.
- Validate on the fly: reject negative and non-numeric input rather than
  crashing the parser later.

**Loading and state**

- Every asynchronous operation has a visible loading state.
- Guard against the spinner flash: if the work finishes in under 150 ms, do not
  show a spinner at all.
- Every list has a designed empty state containing a primary action, not just a
  sentence of text.
- Every error state offers a retry, and states plainly what failed.
- Disable the primary button while its action is in flight so it cannot be
  double-tapped into a double push or a duplicate entry.

**Typography and accessibility**

- All text scales with Dynamic Type. Verify at the largest accessibility size:
  nothing may clip or overlap.
- Every icon-only control has an `accessibilityLabel`. Decorative images are
  marked as decorative so VoiceOver skips them.
- Colour is never the only signal. Pair it with a label, a shape or an icon.
- Honour Reduce Motion: replace movement-heavy transitions with a fade.
- Meet contrast requirements against the palette in section 7. Check the muted
  colour against the background specifically; that is where these palettes fail.

**Formatting**

- Format every number with `NumberFormatter`, never string interpolation. Group
  separators and decimal separators must follow the locale.
- Energy is shown as a whole number of kcal. Macros are shown with at most one
  decimal place.
- Round only at the point of display. Stored values keep full precision.
- Day boundaries use `Calendar.current.startOfDay(for:)` in the user's current
  time zone. Handle the day changing while the app is open, and handle the
  short and long days that daylight saving produces.
- Unknown macro values render as a dash or the word "unknown", never as 0.

**Motion and feedback**

- One haptic on a successful commit (a food logged, a target saved). No haptic
  on navigation.
- Animations are short (0.2 to 0.35 s) and use a single shared easing curve.
- Nothing animates on first appearance of a screen except an intentional entry
  transition.

**Navigation**

- Back always works and never loses entered data without asking.
- A destructive action (delete a log row, reset all data) is confirmed.
- Modal sheets can always be dismissed; there is no dead end.
- Deep state is restorable: relaunching returns the user to a sane screen.


Every item here is a defect if it is missing. Section 7.4 fixed the numbers —
this is where they have to show up on screen.

**Hierarchy and density**

- Every screen has exactly one dominant element (a hero number, a canvas, a
  primary card) that the eye lands on first. A screen where every element has
  equal weight reads as a spreadsheet, not a product.
- Related content is grouped into a card or a section with the elevation
  style from 7.4, not left floating on the bare background.
- Unused flat background is not "minimal" — see the density rule in
  `KNOWLEDGE.md`. If a screen has room left after the mechanic and the
  content, add a secondary surface (a stat strip, a recent-activity card, a
  related-item row), not a `Spacer`.

**Components**

- Every card, sheet, chip, row and button in the app uses the corner radius
  and elevation from section 7.4. No screen introduces its own radius or its
  own shadow value "just for this one card".
- Buttons have a pressed state (`ButtonStyle` with a scale or opacity change
  on `isPressed`) and a disabled state that is visibly different, not just
  non-interactive.
- Chips and badges are pill or rounded-rect shaped per 7.4, never a bare
  `Text` with no background sitting where a control is expected.
- A functional control (add, filter, sort, close, more, share, delete) is an
  SF Symbol inside a properly hit-targeted `Button`. SF Symbols are fine and
  expected here — section 16 only bans them as the app's primary brand
  iconography (app icon, empty-state hero, onboarding art), which is what the
  generated assets in section 13 are for.

**Depth and material**

- At least one surface in the app (a sheet, a modal, a floating toolbar) uses
  the elevation style from 7.4 to visibly sit above the content behind it.
  A flat app with no depth anywhere reads as a wireframe.
- Icons and generated art sit on the surface colour from 7.1, never directly
  on a colour that makes their edges disappear.

**Motion as feedback, not decoration**

- The one dominant element in a screen (7.4's primary control, the mechanic's
  hero) responds visibly to touch: a scale, a colour shift, a haptic — pick
  at least one. A control that looks identical pressed and unpressed reads as
  broken, not calm.

**Taste DNA (section 7.6)**

- Home uses the assigned layout family and density. Three identical equal-weight
  cards, a leftover bento hole, or a second column structure copied down the
  page is a defect.
- Copy follows the assigned voice. No em-dash, no elevate/unlock/seamless, no
  emoji, no SECTION 01 labels.
- Motion follows the assigned personality and honours Reduce Motion with a fade.
  One signature motion per view. No glow stacked on glass stacked on spring.
- Tokens by intent: the live verb wears accent; delete does not wear primary.


---

## 9. Concurrency

The target builds with Swift 6.2 and `SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY = complete`. It
must compile with **zero concurrency warnings**. Warnings here become crashes
later, so they are not negotiable.

- All UI types are `@MainActor`. Annotate the type, not individual methods.
- Any value crossing an actor boundary is `Sendable`. Prefer immutable structs
  of primitives.
- Do not use `@unchecked Sendable`. If it is genuinely unavoidable, it needs a
  comment explaining what guarantees the safety.
- No mutable global state. No `static var` that is written after launch.
- Networking and storage APIs are `async` and honour cancellation. When the
  search query changes, cancel the in-flight task; do not let a stale response
  overwrite fresh results.
- Use structured concurrency. Avoid `Task.detached` unless there is a stated
  reason. Never fire a `Task` that outlives the view without owning it.
- Never use `DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter` to paper over an ordering problem.
  Fix the ordering.
- `Timer` and notification observers are invalidated in `deinit` or on
  disappear.


---

## 10. Persistence engineering

Chosen technology: **UserDefaults+Codable**

One Codable PinacothecaDocument (schemaVersion from 1, Works with file Loose or Called, Cues, Faces, CallMarks, FaultMarks, cached catalog rows, daykeys as Int YYYYMMDD) encoded to JSON Data in UserDefaults under tpt.crate.v1. Lineup case is stored; Called-ness of a Work is the file case, not a parallel bool. In-memory LineupStore is the source of truth; UserDefaults is the projection. Views never touch UserDefaults. Debounce writes. Flush when scenePhase becomes inactive or background, and after Deal, CallMark, FaultMark, Undo, Explore save, or reset. Decoding failure falls back to tpt.crate.v1.backup, then an empty crate, never a crash. resetAllData() is reachable from Settings. Tests use a private UserDefaults suite. Simulator seed only once behind tpt.demo.v1 writes six Loose Works from the local crate shelf so the first Deal already hangs four Faces, files several CallMarks and FaultMarks so Saved is a used product, marks onboarding complete, and never seeds Idle as the first frame. Never seed on a device. Cached works catch empty or failed Met search.

This app persists to **files on disk**. The following are mandatory.

- Write atomically. Either `Data.write(to:options: .atomic)` or write to a
  temporary file and `FileManager.replaceItemAt`. A non-atomic write that is
  interrupted leaves a truncated file and the app will not launch.
- Create the containing directory with
  `withIntermediateDirectories: true` before the first write.
- Every document carries a `schemaVersion` field from version 1, and the decoder
  switches on it.
- Decoding failure must be recoverable: keep the previous good file as a
  `.backup`, fall back to it, and if that also fails start from empty state and
  tell the user. Never crash on a corrupt file.
- All file IO happens off the main thread. The main thread never blocks on disk.
- Debounce writes during rapid edits, but force a flush when `scenePhase`
  becomes `.inactive` or `.background`, and after any destructive action.
- Exclude caches from backup with `URLResourceValues.isExcludedFromBackup` where
  appropriate; user data belongs in Application Support and should be backed up.
- Keep an explicit in-memory source of truth and treat the file as a projection
  of it, so a failed write never leaves the UI showing data that does not exist.


Regardless of technology:

- One seam between domain logic and storage; the UI never touches storage types.
- Writes survive a force-quit. Do not rely on `applicationWillTerminate`.
- Provide `resetAllData()`, used by tests and reachable from Settings.

## 11. Networking

- One client type owns both Open Food Facts endpoints.
- Set `User-Agent` on every request. Open Food Facts throttles clients that do
  not identify themselves.
- 15 second timeout. One retry on a transient transport failure, then a typed
  error. Do not retry a 404.
- Cancel the in-flight search when the query changes. Debounce input by roughly
  300 ms.
- Decode into DTO types that mirror the JSON exactly, then map to domain types.
  Never decode straight into your domain model.
- Dedicated `JSONDecoder` with `.useDefaultKeys`. Never `convertFromSnakeCase` —
  Open Food Facts keys like `energy-kcal_100g` break snake_case conversion.
- Resolve a scanned code with `GET /api/v2/product/<barcode>.json`, not a search.
- Open Food Facts data is user-contributed and frequently incomplete. Every
  numeric field is optional. A product with no energy value is a normal case
  that the UI must present, not an error.
- Some numeric fields arrive as strings. The decoder must accept both a number
  and a numeric string for every nutriment.
- `status` of `0` in the product response means not found. Map it to a distinct
  error case so the UI can offer manual entry.
- Never crash on malformed JSON. A decoding failure is a handled error.
- Cache every resolved product locally on success, so the app degrades to a
  working offline catalogue.


Set `User-Agent: Tetraptych/1.0 (iOS; +https://tetraptych-lineup.pro)` on every request. Never reuse another app's string.
Use the **cgi search pl** search endpoint for this app.

---

## 11b. App Store readiness

The app must be submittable without further work.

- `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` in the target, declaring the UserDefaults access API
  reason `CA92.1` and the file timestamp reason `C617.1`, with
  `NSPrivacyTracking` false and no collected data types.
- `INFOPLIST_KEY_ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption = NO` in the pbxproj so TestFlight
  does not sit on Missing Compliance.
- `NSCameraUsageDescription` written specifically for this app. Generic strings
  get rejected.
- `LSApplicationCategoryType` of `public.app-category.healthcare-fitness`.
- Portrait only, iPhone and iPad (`TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY = "1,2"`).
- No account, no sign-in, no delete-account flow, no in-app purchase, no ads, no
  user-generated content, and therefore no report or block UI.
- App Tracking Transparency is never invoked.
- The camera is the only sensitive permission requested.
- Guideline 5.1.1 (Privacy): do not encourage or direct the user to grant camera
  access. A pre-permission screen may exist, but the proceed button must be
  **Continue** or **Next** — never "Allow camera", "Enable camera",
  "Grant camera", or a bare Allow/Enable that calls `requestAccess`. The
  system dialog is the only Allow. Denied/restricted offers Open Settings.
- The app must not present itself as a clinician or as medical advice.
- Guideline 4.2 (Design — Minimum Functionality): the binary must be a native
  product, not a web browsing experience. No WKWebView / SFSafariViewController
  / UIWebView as home, a tab, or the primary UX. A content catalog, article
  reader, or site wrapper that could be a website is a reject. Push
  notifications, Core Location, and sharing do not make that acceptable.
- Guideline 1.4.1 (Safety — Physical Harm): if the binary shows health or
  medical recommendations, body-based targets, dosages, "you should" guidance,
  or product health claims (food, drink, supplement, remedy), put citations
  in the app. Tappable links to the sources, easy to find: same screen as the
  claim, or a Sources row one tap from Settings. Name the source (Open Food
  Facts, USDA FoodData Central, WHO, NIH MedlinePlus, …) and link it. A
  "not medical advice" footer without sources is a reject. A personal log
  that never advises does not invent claims to cite.
- Nutrition catalog data is credited to the database this app actually uses
  (Open Food Facts unless the spec names another). Credit is a tappable link,
  not a dead "OpenFoodFacts" label.


Ignore the food-log and Open Food Facts lines above when they conflict with this
family. Category for this app is `public.app-category.education`. Camera permission only if the
product actually captures.

Project settings that follow from the above:

```yaml
INFOPLIST_KEY_UIUserInterfaceStyle: Light
INFOPLIST_KEY_UISupportedInterfaceOrientations: UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait
INFOPLIST_KEY_UISupportedInterfaceOrientations_iPad: UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait
INFOPLIST_KEY_UIRequiresFullScreen: YES
INFOPLIST_KEY_ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption: NO
INFOPLIST_KEY_LSApplicationCategoryType: public.app-category.education
TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY: "1,2"
SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY: complete

## 12. Functional twist: Cue-then-call (Deal writes a Cue as Artist or Title and hangs four Faces; Call files the matching Face and writes a CallMark; a miss writes a FaultMark and keeps the Cue; Deal on fewer than four Works writes Idle)

Cue-then-call is the home verb: Deal writes a Cue as Artist or Title and hangs four Faces from Loose Works, then the learner taps the matching Face so a CallMark files that Work as Called. A wrong tap writes a FaultMark, dims that Face, and the Cue stays so the lineup does not advance. Deal on a crate under four Loose Works writes Idle, and Deal while Cued is refused. Called works rest on Saved and exit the deal pool; FaultMarks stay reviewable there; Undo lifts the latest CallMark or FaultMark from the dock. Explore only stocks Loose works from The Metropolitan Museum of Art or the local crate shelf; Simulator seed stores six Loose Works, deals so four Faces already hang, and files several CallMarks and FaultMarks so Saved is a used product. Saved tallies CallMarks and FaultMarks; Settings names The Metropolitan Museum of Art as the only catalog voice; stars, a shopping list, a shop, and a WebView museum do not exist.

This is the app's marketed differentiator. It must be:

- visible on the home screen, not buried in settings;
- backed by real persisted data, not a cosmetic flourish;
- covered by at least one unit test;
- described in the README as the reason a user would pick this app.

## 13. AI-generated assets

Art style: **3D glass render glassmorphism · take lineup**


This assignment restates a catalog technique another app already holds. Write a new composition: new types, new layout, new motion. Do not copy source, file trees, or type names from the holder.

Base prompt, reused and extended for every asset:

```
3D glass render, glassmorphism, studio-lit tetraptych of four hanging faces, refractive panes and soft bloom, isolated subjects, quiet uncluttered ground, no text, no letters, no logo, no photoreal stock, no specified colours, four faces in one lineup not a single easel and not a museum corridor
```

All 15 images below are required. Generate each one, export
as PNG, and add it to `Assets.xcassets` as its own image set named exactly as
given. Every name carries the `tpt_` prefix.

### 13.1 App icon rules (strict)

The icon is rejected by App Store Connect if any of these are wrong:

- Exactly **1024 x 1024 px**.
- **No alpha channel.**
- sRGB colour profile, 8 bits per channel, PNG.
- **No text and no words** in the artwork.
- **No rounded corners and no built-in mask.**
- The subject stays inside the middle 80%.

| 8 | `tpt_CardBackdrop` | 1200x800 | fill | Backdrop art for a primary card. Low contrast so text stays readable. |
| 9 | `tpt_ControlFace` | 512x512 | **required cutout** | Custom control artwork used for the primary interactive element. |
| 10 | `tpt_TwistHero` | 1024x1024 | **required cutout** | Hero art for the 'Cue-then-call (Deal writes a Cue as Artist or Title and hangs four Faces; Call files the matching Face and writes a CallMark; a miss writes a FaultMark and keeps the Cue; Deal on fewer than four Works writes Idle)' feature screen. |

### 13.3 Asset rules

- Cut-outs (everything except AppIcon, Splash, CardBackdrop): isolated subject,
  real PNG alpha, all four corners transparent. No square plate.
- Assets must be semantically different from each other.
- Record the exact prompt used for every asset in the README.
- SF Symbols are permitted only for close, chevron, share and similar system
  affordances.

Scanner frames, reticles, and seamless tiles are drawn in SwiftUI via `Path` or `Shape`. GenerateImage is not used for those. Every other in-app graphic (except AppIcon, Splash, CardBackdrop) is a **cutout**: isolated SOLID opaque subject in the center, real PNG alpha, all four corners transparent. An opaque square plate inside a circle or pentagon is a fail. A hollow glass box or wire frame with a transparent center is a fail.

---

## 14. Demo data

Seed a small local demo dataset for this family's entities so Simulator
screenshots are not empty. The same seed must mark onboarding complete and
fill the primary surface — otherwise `-ReviewScreen` never fires. Never seed
on a physical device. Guard with `#if targetEnvironment(simulator)` and
`tpt.demo.v1`.

Seed the happy path: the home primary verb is enabled. The blocked / gated /
error state is a unit-test fixture, not Simulator home. Home chrome names the
job and the next tap in words a stranger knows. Axis values (`ui`, `naming`,
`architecture`) never become user-visible titles. A card that looks tappable
is a `Button`. A readout does not use button chrome.

---

## 16. Anti-patterns

The following will fail review:

- `try!`, `as!`, or force-unwrapping anything derived from the network, the
  database or a file.
- `fatalError` anywhere reachable at runtime. It is acceptable only for a
  programmer error in an initialiser that cannot fail in practice, and needs a
  comment.
- Swallowing an error with an empty `catch`.
- `print` used as production logging.
- A hard-coded hex colour outside the single colour accessor.
- A hard-coded font name outside the single typography accessor.
- An SF Symbol used as the app's brand iconography — the app icon, the
  empty-state hero, or onboarding art. Those come from section 13. SF Symbols
  are the right choice for every functional control (add, filter, sort,
  close, share, delete) — leaving those as bare text instead of a symbol is
  also a defect.
- Storing a value that can be computed (day totals, remaining budget, macro
  percentages).
- Blocking the main thread on disk or network work.
- `UIScreen.main` for sizing. Use the geometry the layout system gives you.
- Index positions used as list identity. Identity is a stable identifier.
- A view that reaches into the persistence layer directly, bypassing the
  architecture's designated seam.
- Business logic inside a `View` body or a `UIViewController` method, when the
  assigned architecture places it elsewhere.
- Copying a source file from another app in this batch.
- A `TabView` with exactly three tabs. That is the factory stamp — two or
  four-to-five destinations, or a different chrome. ReviewScreen keys are
  not tabs.


---

## 17. Tests

Add a unit test target `TetraptychTests` covering at minimum:

1. The core domain invariant of this family (the thing that would be wrong if
   the calculator, decay, crate, or log lied).
2. Empty, populated and invalid input paths for the primary verb.
3. The section 12 twist logic.
4. One architecture-specific test proving the pattern holds.
5. A persistence round-trip: write, relaunch-equivalent reload, verify.
6. Parse `ProcessInfo.processInfo.arguments` once after onboarding. 
   `-ReviewScreen today|log|goals` switches the running app's live navigation. Extra cover slugs open those screens.
   Cover that parser with a unit test. Do not host a `View` in the test.

---

## 18. README.md

Write `README.md` at the app folder root covering:

1. What the app does and who it is for.
2. The architecture used and **why** it suits this product.
3. The unique feature added and how it works.
4. The AI art style and the exact prompt used for every asset.
5. How this app differs from others in the batch.
6. Build instructions.

## 20. Build commands

```bash
cd Tetraptych
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -scheme Tetraptych -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO build
xcrun simctl list devices available
xcodebuild -scheme Tetraptych -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=<UDID>' test
```

Signing is off only on that command line. Do not put CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED, CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED, CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY or DEVELOPMENT_TEAM in project.yml — CI signs the archive. Leave CODE_SIGN_STYLE: Automatic as the scaffold set it. The exact simulator does not matter — use any available UDID from the list.
